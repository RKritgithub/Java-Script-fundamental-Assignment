 <p>Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are essential in programming as they help in executing calculations, comparisons, logical decisions, and more.  

    ### **Types of Operators in JavaScript**:  
    1. **Arithmetic Operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, `--`) – Perform mathematical operations.  
    2. **Comparison Operators** (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) – Compare values.  
    3. **Logical Operators** (`&&`, `||`, `!`) – Combine or invert conditions.  
    4. **Assignment Operators** (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) – Assign values.  
    5. **Bitwise Operators** (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) – Work at the binary level.  
    
    Operators are crucial as they allow JavaScript to handle data dynamically, making programs more functional and interactive.</p>
